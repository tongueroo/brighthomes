			Admittedly, you can’t see “client service” in any of our portfolio photos. And unfortunately they don’t give trophies for “best order tracking by an interior design firm”. But at Martin Perri, it's been our private crusade to prove that creativity and customer service are not mutually exclusive.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are a few examples of what that means for our clients:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We process orders, follow up with the factories and review confirmations;
			</li>
			<li>We order finish samples, coordinate getting fabrics from the mill to the manufacturer, and make sure fabrics are applied in the correct direction;
			</li>
			<li>We check and update schedules, expedite orders, track shipments, and keep you apprised throughout the process;
			</li>
			<li>Furnishings, artwork and accessories are checked and perfected before they get to your home;
			</li>
			<li>We can warehouse items as they come in and deliver a complete order, meeting deliveries at your home to do a final quality check; and,
			</li>
			<li>We have the support and systems to take care of all the details and any problems that arise – fast.
			</li>
		</ul>
